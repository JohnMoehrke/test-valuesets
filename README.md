# Test ValueSet 

Testing various uses of ValueSet.

- ci-build - http://build.fhir.org/ig/JohnMoehrke/test-valuesets/branches/main/index.html
- ci-build for FHIR R6 - https://build.fhir.org/ig/JohnMoehrke/test-valuesets/branches/R6/index.html

## Status

This is a trial IG to explore using ValueSets.

One topic is the availability of SAMHSA ValueSets, and their inclusion of inactive codes. Inactive codes are not good for new data, but they are critical for historic data.
